## Introduction
`easy_swmm` is a third-party library designed to easily manipulate and save `.inp` files for EPA SWMM.  
It was created to build upon the strengths of existing libraries for editing `.inp` files, while also allowing the parsing of custom placeholder values within sections — a valuable tool for operational pipelines.

The library is currently a **work in progress**.
